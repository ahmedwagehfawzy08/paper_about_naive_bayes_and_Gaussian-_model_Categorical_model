# paper_about_naive_bayes_and_Gaussian-_model_Categorical_model
This repository explores the Naive Bayes classifier, focusing on two key implementations:  Gaussian Naive Bayes Model: Ideal for continuous data, assuming a normal distribution for each feature. Categorical Naive Bayes Model: Tailored for discrete categorical data, leveraging conditional probabilities for classification.
